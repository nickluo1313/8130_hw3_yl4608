The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset.

To that end, write a short description of the dataset, noting the size
and structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving
illstrative examples of observations

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 1000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog fodd care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name        |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar    |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda     |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar           |  336 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries  | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries  | 4966 |    3 |

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples","Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

| product\_name    |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |        4 |        5 |        6 |
| :--------------- | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: |
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 | 15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44118 | 11.36000 | 11.70213 | 14.25000 | 11.55172 | 12.78431 | 11.93750 |

## Problem 2

In this spreadsheet, variables activity.\* are the activity counts for
each minute of a 24-hour day starting at midnight.

Q: Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
with reasonable variable classes.

``` r
accel_data = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  # pivot to long format
  pivot_longer(
    activity.1 : activity.1440,
    names_to = "activity_count",
    values_to = "minute"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_vs_weekend = 
      ifelse(day == 'Friday' | day == 'Saturday', "weekend", "weekday"),
    weekday_vs_weekend = as.factor(weekday_vs_weekend),
    activity_count = as.character(activity_count)
  ) %>%
  separate(activity_count, into = c("acti","count"), sep = 9) %>% 
  mutate(
    count = as.integer(count)
  ) %>% 
  select(-acti)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
head(accel_data) %>% 
knitr::kable()
```

| week | day\_id | day    | count |   minute | weekday\_vs\_weekend |
| ---: | ------: | :----- | ----: | -------: | :------------------- |
|    1 |       1 | Friday |     1 | 88.37778 | weekend              |
|    1 |       1 | Friday |     2 | 82.24444 | weekend              |
|    1 |       1 | Friday |     3 | 64.44444 | weekend              |
|    1 |       1 | Friday |     4 | 70.04444 | weekend              |
|    1 |       1 | Friday |     5 | 75.04444 | weekend              |
|    1 |       1 | Friday |     6 | 66.26667 | weekend              |

Q:

Describe the resulting dataset (e.g. what variables exist, how many
observations, etc).

A:

The dataset contains all the recorded activity of the patient, given
that record interval is 1 minute. It contains variables week, day\_id,
day, count, minute, weekday\_vs\_weekend, and it has a total dimension
of \[50,400 x 6\]. The total observation is 50400.
