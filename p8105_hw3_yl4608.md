The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset.

To that end, write a short description of the dataset, noting the size
and structure of the data, describing some key variables, and giving
illstrative examples of observations

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 1000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog fodd care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name        |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar    |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda     |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar           |  336 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries  | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries  | 4966 |    3 |

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples","Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

| product\_name    |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |        4 |        5 |        6 |

## Problem 2

In this spreadsheet, variables activity.\* are the activity counts for
each minute of a 24-hour day starting at midnight.

Q: Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
with reasonable variable classes.

``` r
accel_data = 
  read_csv(file = "./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  # pivot to long format
  pivot_longer(
    activity.1 : activity.1440,
    names_to = "activity_count",
    values_to = "minute"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_vs_weekend = 
      ifelse(day == 'Friday' | day == 'Saturday', "weekend", "weekday"),
    weekday_vs_weekend = as.factor(weekday_vs_weekend),
    activity_count = as.character(activity_count),
    day = as.factor(day)
  ) %>%
  separate(activity_count, into = c("acti","count"), sep = 9) %>% 
  mutate(
    count = as.integer(count)
  ) %>% 
  select(-acti) 
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
# take a look at the tidy data
head(accel_data) %>% 
knitr::kable()
```

| week | day\_id | day    | count |   minute | weekday\_vs\_weekend |
| ---: | ------: | :----- | ----: | -------: | :------------------- |
|    1 |       1 | Friday |     1 | 88.37778 | weekend              |
|    1 |       1 | Friday |     2 | 82.24444 | weekend              |
|    1 |       1 | Friday |     3 | 64.44444 | weekend              |
|    1 |       1 | Friday |     4 | 70.04444 | weekend              |
|    1 |       1 | Friday |     5 | 75.04444 | weekend              |
|    1 |       1 | Friday |     6 | 66.26667 | weekend              |

Q:

Describe the resulting dataset (e.g. what variables exist, how many
observations, etc).

A:

The dataset contains all the recorded activity of the patient, given
that record interval is 1 minute. It contains variables week, day\_id,
day, count, minute, weekday\_vs\_weekend, and it has a total dimension
of \[50,400 x 6\]. The total observation is 50400.

Q:

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day.Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to
create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table
showing these totals.

``` r
# create a table showing total activity
accel_data_df1 =
  accel_data %>% 
  group_by(day_id) %>% 
  summarize(total_activity = sum(minute))
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

``` r
# show the table
accel_data_df1 %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| day\_id | total\_activity |

Q:

Are any trends apparent?

``` r
accel_data_df2 = 
  right_join(x = accel_data, y = accel_data_df1) 
```

    ## Joining, by = "day_id"

``` r
# detect any trend using line plot and smooth line plot

# preliminary:
# scatterplot: total activity by day_id
accel_data_df2 %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = day_id, y = total_activity)) + 
  geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw3_yl4608_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# smooth curve: total activity by day_id
accel_data_df2 %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = day_id, total_activity)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

![](p8105_hw3_yl4608_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# boxplot: total activity by day
accel_data_df2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day, total_activity)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

![](p8105_hw3_yl4608_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-3.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# density: total activity by weekend
accel_data_df2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total_activity, fill = weekday_vs_weekend)) +      geom_density(alpha = 0.5, adjust = 0.9)
```

![](p8105_hw3_yl4608_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-4.png)<!-- -->

A:

According to the scatter smooth curve, there is a limited evidence of
trend, which indicates that the activity increases as the observational
days increase, and it decreases after the 18th day. It returns back to a
higher value at 35th day.

In relation to each weekdays, each day have different means and range.
However, Satureday has the largest range for activity. Wednesday and
Tuesday have a very little range.

Observe the weekday and weekend’s relation with daily acitivity, we can
say that weekdays have a more stable activity, while weekend activity
often varies a lot.

It should be noted, that the observational time is limited in 5 weeks.
Some more significant observations can be made about the weekday
weekends’ relation to daily activity if the time period is longer.

Q:

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph.

``` r
accel_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, count)) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = c(0, 240, 480, 720, 960, 1200, 1440),
    labels = c("0:00", "04:00", "08:00", "12:00", "16:00", "20:00", "24:00")
  ) 
```
